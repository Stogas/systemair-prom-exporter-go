    - errcheck # Errcheck is a program for checking for unchecked errors in Go code. These unchecked errors can be critical bugs in some cases.
    - gosimple # Linter for Go source code that specializes in simplifying code.
    - govet # Vet examines Go source code and reports suspicious constructs. It is roughly the same as 'go vet' and uses its passes.
    - ineffassign # Detects when assignments to existing variables are not used.
    - staticcheck # It's a set of rules from staticcheck. It's not the same thing as the staticcheck binary.
    - unused # Checks Go code for unused constants, variables, functions and types.
    # additional
    - goimports # Check import statements are formatted according to the 'goimport' command. Reformat imports in autofix mode.
    - misspell # Finds commonly misspelled English words.
    - sloglint # Ensure consistent code style when using log/slog.
    - godox # Tool for detection of FIXME, TODO and other comment keywords.
    - funlen # Tool for detection of long functions.
    - gocognit # Computes and checks the cognitive complexity of functions.
    - goconst # Finds repeated strings that could be replaced by a constant.
    - gocritic # Provides diagnostics that check for bugs, performance and style issues.
    - gosec # Inspects source code for security problems.
